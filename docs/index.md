At the time of submitting their application, all Visual Arts Conservatory applicants will upload only three (3) pieces of art, created as a response to the three (3) specific Artwork Prompts listed below. Please scan the three
artworks and combine into a single PDF.

^^Artwork Prompt # 1:^^ Using any traditional art medium (drawing or painting) or digital art medium,
please create a COLOR image of your favorite meal or snack that includes the wrapper or the bowl or
plate it sits on. Please include eating utensils if required. You could also add the surface area such as a
tablecloth or the environment around the food. Be mindful of texture on objects and utensil reflections.
Be sure to use COLOR in your design. Work on paper - document size 8.5” x 11” or larger. Any art
media is fine as long as it includes color.

^^Artwork Prompt # 2:^^ Use a #2 lead pencil (no color) and an eraser to create an observational drawing
of four small objects together on one table surface using different VALUES (shades of light to dark).
Make sure at least one item is shiny/reflective and one item is soft fabric (a plushie stuffed animal or
clothing item). Objects should sit together in a scene and should tell a story about your personality or
interests and experiences. Objects could be shoes, sunglasses, small toys, bottles, seashells, plants,
postcards, small electronics or most any other small item. Drawing of objects should be realistic and
should include shading, shadows, texture and volume. Hand-drawn with a #2 lead pencil on plain
paper, size 8.5” x 11” or larger. (Not digital)

^^Artwork Prompt # 3:^^ Design an ORIGINAL HERO CHARACTER with THEIR PET MASCOT
Using any traditional (drawing or painting) or digital art medium, design an original hero character for a
fictional story of your own creation. Your illustration should be a color full-body illustration and include
one animal pet/mascot. As you design your character, think about shape-language, color and props that
will help your hero character look even better and help tell the story of your character. Have fun with it.
